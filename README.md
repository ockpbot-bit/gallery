# Gallery Website Prototype

Static implementation of the *trippled.studio* prototype provided by Rasa.

## Stack
- Pure HTML + CSS (no build tools)
- Google Fonts: Cormorant Garamond + Inter
- Placeholder imagery sourced from Unsplash

## Getting Started
```bash
# from repo root
yarn # (not required, there are no dependencies)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# visit http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in a browser.

## Development Notes
- Styles live in `styles.css`; no preprocessors.
- Images are referenced via remote URLs, so an internet connection is required for placeholders.
- Replace placeholder copy/artwork before going live.

## Preview
`preview.png` captures the current layout.
